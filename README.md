========
I'm Charles E. O. Otieno, a Nairobi based freelance web developer and designer. I passionately move pixels and lines of code to craft clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.

My current weapons of choice are PHP Laravel, HTML5, jQuery, and MySQL. Being both an engineer and designer, I help clients bring their ideas into reality. I enjoy working directly with my clients, rather than having project managers involved.
